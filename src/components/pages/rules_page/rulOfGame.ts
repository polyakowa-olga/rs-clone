            <span>build your monopoly<span>
        </h1>
        <p class="text-about-game">The Capitalist is a economic strategy based on the market model of financial
            corporations. Modern remake of the game that has conquered the hearts of millions of players
            around
            the world and entered into history as Monopoly.</p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            The goal of the game is to maximize your starting capital and to ruin other players by
            buying up
            assets or getting them through deals concluded with your competitors, through smart
            combinations, or
            by winning the auctions. Only one player wins - the capitalist who stayed afloat, managed to
            make
            the largest fortune and ruined all his rivals. </p>

            great
            company! Playing this game you develop your business thinking, the ability to reach

        <p class="text-about-game">The dynamics of the game and its duration is unpredictable and depends on the
            number of
            players and
            their personalities. Some, playing monopoly, fighting to the end, even if at first glance
            the
            situation seems hopeless, others, on the contrary, give up as soon as they feel that the
            game is not
            in their favor, although in most cases this is a misconception, because in online monopoly,
            as in
            the classic board game, a gameplay advantage can radically change up to several times for a
            game.

        <h2>How to play
            <span>game rules and basic principles<span>
        </h2>
        <p class="text-about-game">From 2 to 5 players inclusive can take part in one game. The winner is the
            last
            player who has not gone bankrupt. In case the last remaining two players failed to ruin each other
            within two hours, the winner is the player whose total capital is greater (total value of all assets
            and
            cash).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-game-rules">
        <h3>Start of Play</h3>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            At the beginning of the game each player is provided with a start-up capital of $1,500. The chips of
            all players are automatically placed on the starting field. </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            The right of the first turn is determined automatically, using a random number generator. The player
            has no more than 2 minutes for each turn. A player who fails to complete his turn within the
            allotted time is automatically declared bankrupt and retired from the game.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            Players take turns rolling a pair of dice, in the order of places they occupy the gaming table. The
            player's chip moves clockwise by the number of fields corresponding to the sum of numbers obtained
            on the dice as a result of the roll.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-game-rules">
        <h3>Asset Purchases</h3>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            If the dice roll brings you into the field of a company that is not yet owned by anyone, you are
            entitled to buy this asset for the price indicated in this field. You can get information about the
            profitability of the company by clicking on this field.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            When you do not have enough 'cash' for it or at the moment you do not want to spend it, you can
            borrow from a virtual bank to buy desirable asset (a chargeable service). You can only take a single
            credit at a time and get a new one by repaying the current one.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            If you decide not to buy the asset, it must be auctioned off. The other players take turns bidding
            at the auction, or refuse to bid. The auction step is $10,000. The highest bidder becomes the owner
            of the asset.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            When you become the owner of an asset, you begin to receive dividends every time your opponent hits
            the field of this company. The opponent in this case is obliged to pay to the owner the amount
            indicated on this field.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-game-rules">
        <h3>Asset Development</h3>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            Your goal is to develop your existing assets to generate more profit. For this purpose it is
            necessary to take possession of all companies of one or several countries - in other words, to take
            possession of the monopoly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            By owning the monopoly, you can buy shares of your monopoly companies while making a turn, which
            significantly increases the profitability of the company for you and causes more damage to your
            opponents when they hit these fields. You can get information about the profitability of the company
            depending on the number of available shares by pressing on its field.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-game-rules">
        <h3>Deals</h3>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            You can also take possession of the asset you need to build a monopoly by making deals with other
            players: if another player already has the asset you need, you can offer him money and/or another
            company in exchange.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            Remember that exchange combinations to get the desired company may consist of a chain of
            transactions with several players, so it is better to negotiate a deal with your opponents in
            advance, via personal messages or in a chat.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            Exchange combinations should be comparable in value: gifts, favours, loans are not allowed.
            Violation of this rule will result in penalties, including blocking a player's account. Fair Play is
            one of The Capitalist's priorities.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-game-rules">
        <h3>Payment of Dividends</h3>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            If as a result of a turn you enter the field of a company already owned by your opponent, you must
            pay the owner the amount marked on this field.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            To pay off your debt, you can use both the money you already have and the money you can get from the
            bank against the security of your companies or the sale of your shares, for which you will see the
            corresponding interface buttons at the moment of debt payment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            If the total capital of the player (the total value of all assets and cash) is insufficient to pay
            off the debt, the player is declared bankrupt and leaves the game.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-game-rules">
        <h3>Bonus Fields</h3>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            On the game board there are two bonus fields called Chance, getting on which you can get an
            unplanned profit. The amount of bonuses varies and depends only on your luck.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            In addition, each time you complete a full round of play and pass through the starting field, you
            get an unconditional income of $200.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-game-rules">
        <h3>Penalty Fields</h3>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            On the game board there are two penalty fields called Force Majeure, hitting which you incur losses,
            the size of which can also be different.
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            Tax. Once here, you will have to pay taxes of 6% of all your capital (total value of all assets and
            cash).
        </p>
        <p class="text-about-game">
            Customs Clearance. Your chip moves into the Customs field and gets arrested. You will have to pay a
            fine of $50,000 for leaving this field or roll a double on dice in one of three attempts. A direct
            hit on the Customs field will not result in any penalties.
